# IOT_Sensor

## Description

This project is an IoT ecosystem simulator, referring to the collection of devices and software that enable connection, data collection, communication, and management of physical objects (or "things") via the Internet. In our case, these objects will be represented by various types of sensors. The primary goal of this project is to apply the C++ concepts learned during the course.

## User Manual

1. **Configuration Selection:**
   At startup, the program prompts you to choose between default configuration and manual configuration.

2. **Default Configuration:**
   If you opt for the default configuration, the program automatically displays sensor data on the console and logs it into dedicated log files for each sensor.

3. **Manual Ecosystem Configuration:**
   If you choose manual configuration, you need to specify:
   - The number of sensors to simulate.
   - The measurement time for each sensor.
   - Activation of logging and console display.

4. **Data Display:**
   After configuration, the program displays sensor data based on your chosen configuration.
